#Plotting  
We're going to look at the Instacart dataset and graph a scatterplot, line graph and bar graph.Plotly was used to produce the following graphs below as well as the ones produced in the dashboard. 

```{r scatter}
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~aisle, y = ~n, color = ~aisle, type = "scatter")
```


```{r}
instacart %>% 
  sample_n(10) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~mean, x = ~product_name, type = "scatter", mode = "line")
```


```{r barchart}
instacart %>% 
  count(department) %>% 
  mutate(department = fct_reorder(department, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~department, y = ~n, color = ~department, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
```
