My name is Teshawna Badu. I was born and raised in New York. I am a Ghanaian-American, who is currently studying at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am an MPH candidate in Epidemiology department with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science. My research interests include data science, the built environment, maternal health and global health.

In my leisure time, I enjoy watching "Bad Reality TV", trying recipes from YouTube and crocheting. I also enjoy going on long walks and reading. African literature is one of my favorite book genres, and a recent thrilling read I enjoyed was Freshwater by Akwaeke Emezi.
